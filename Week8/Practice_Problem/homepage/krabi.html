            <h3>What to do in Krabi</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Ao Nang: Hit the Beach
                    <p>Tourists love the south of Thailand for the incomparable beach towns found along the perfect
                        coastline of the Andaman Sea. This corner of Krabi perfectly illustrates why, with relaxing
                        resorts, gear rental galore, and the opportunity to snorkel and dive your heart out. From both
                        Ao Nang and Nopparat Thara Beach, boats are available to bear visitors across the water, whether
                        to explore other parts of the coastline or to make a landing on one of the scenic islands that
                        float on the horizon.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    West Railay Beach: The Real Deal
                    <p>Only accessible by boat, this exclusive stretch of sand is one of the most beautiful and iconic
                        beaches in the world. The dramatic outcrops of rock that shoot skyward from the ocean are the
                        postcard image of southern Thailand, and seeing this view for yourself is an unforgettable
                        experience. For a challenge, while you're there, go exploring the Diamond Cave. Mind-blowing
                        geologic formations await inside for a thrilling contrast to the bright blue waters and sunny
                        beach on the other side.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ko Phi Phi: Escape to the Sea
                    <p>Thailand's Phi Phi Islands are the ultimate destination for vacationers to Thailand, and there is
                        nothing quite like taking a speedboat from Krabi Town out to these tiny plots of perfection.
                        Craggy cliffs covered in lush jungle rise mystically from the horizon. The two largest islands
                        boast world-class beaches, and Koh Phi Phi Leh, the smaller of the two, offers even more
                        secluded exploration. Maya Bay is particularly impressive, surrounded by limestone cliffs and
                        inaccessible from the sea.</p>

                <li>
                    Wat Tham Suea: What a View!
                    <p>This highlight of Krabi Town is a stunning example of local devotion. Atop a hill surrounded by
                        sweeping landscapes, an enormous golden Buddha keeps an eye on the region from an elevation of
                        nearly 1000 feet. The shrine is awe-inspiring, and from the shimmering peak, you can see the
                        whole town of Krabi down below, along with a whole series of other temples beckoning to be
                        explored; most notably the Wat Kaew Korawaram.</p>

                <li>
                    Mu Ko Lanta National Park: From Land to Sea
                    <p>Krabi Province is a natural paradise, both on land and at sea, and down the coastline, a series
                        of large islands split off from the mainland - host to Mu Ko Lanta National Park. Mountainous
                        terrain full of lush vegetation takes over the land, towering over the occasional mellow beach
                        peeking out from the coastline down below. Varied and surprising at every turn, these parklands
                        are just begging to be explored. Diving is also popular, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a
                        better place for it.</p>
